## üìû SUPPORT & QUESTIONS

### For the 13-Year-Old Developer

**Q: How do I modify the AI difficulty?**
A: Edit `ai.js` - change the miss probability (Easy), evaluation weights (Medium), or lookahead depth (Hard)

**Q: Can I change the board colors?**
A: Yes! Edit `styles.css` - search for `.square.light` and `.square.dark`

**Q: How do I add sound effects?**
A: Create an Audio object in `ui.js`:
```javascript
const moveSound = new Audio('move.mp3');
moveSound.play();
```

**Q: Can I make the pieces different shapes?**
A: Yes! Modify `.piece` class in `styles.css` or add images

**Q: How do I add a timer?**
A: Add a `setInterval()` in `ui.js` that decrements time and displays it
