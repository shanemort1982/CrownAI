## 🎓 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

### CSS Innovations Used
- **CSS Custom Properties** (variables) for maintainability
- **CSS `min()` function** for responsive board sizing
- **`aspect-ratio`** to maintain square board
- **Flexbox with wrapping** for responsive layout
- **Media queries** with mobile-first approach
- **Percentage-based piece sizing** for true responsiveness

### JavaScript Optimizations
- **Memoization/Caching** for expensive calculations
- **Early termination** to avoid unnecessary work
- **Timeout protection** for long operations
- **Depth limiting** for recursion safety
- **Error boundaries** for graceful degradation
- **Async UI updates** with setTimeout

### Performance Patterns
- **Lazy evaluation** - only calculate when needed
- **Result caching** - store expensive calculations
- **Early returns** - exit loops as soon as possible
- **Timeout guards** - prevent infinite operations
- **Resource cleanup** - clear caches when needed
