## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ✅ Black Pieces Now Visible on Dark Squares

**Problem**: Black pieces on black squares were nearly invisible, making the game unplayable.

**Solution**:
- Added **4px solid white outline** to all black (AI) pieces
- Added **3px solid black outline** to all white (player) pieces
- Kings have **5px outlines** for extra distinction
- Used CSS `border` property with additional `box-shadow` for depth

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
.piece.ai {
    background: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 30%, #2a2a2a, #000);
    border: 4px solid #fff;  /* White outline for visibility */
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2), 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

.piece.player {
    background: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 30%, #fff, #e0e0e0);
    border: 3px solid #000;  /* Black outline for clarity */
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

.piece.king {
    border-width: 5px;  /* Thicker for kings */
}
```

**Result**: All pieces are now clearly visible on both light and dark squares! 🎉

### 2. ✅ Fixed Deselection Bug

**Problem**: Once a piece was selected, you couldn't click it again to deselect it.

**Solution**: Added logic in `ui.js` to detect when clicking the same piece again and deselect it.

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Check if clicking the same piece again (deselect)
if (this.selectedSquare && 
    parseInt(this.selectedSquare.dataset.row) === row && 
    parseInt(this.selectedSquare.dataset.col) === col) {
    this.deselectPiece();
} else {
    this.selectPiece(row, col);
}
```

**Result**: You can now click a piece to deselect it and choose a different piece! 👆

## 📐 RESPONSIVE DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

### 3. ✅ Dynamic Board Scaling

**Problem**: Board had fixed 640px size that didn't fit all screens, requiring zoom out to 90%.

**Solution**: Implemented responsive board sizing using modern CSS functions.

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
:root {
    --board-max-size: 600px;
    --board-min-size: 400px;
}

.game-board {
    width: min(var(--board-max-size), 90vw, calc(100vh - 180px));
    height: min(var(--board-max-size), 90vw, calc(100vh - 180px));
    min-width: var(--board-min-size);
    min-height: var(--board-min-size);
    aspect-ratio: 1/1;
}
```

**Result**: Board now scales between 400px-600px based on viewport size! 📱💻

---

### 4. ✅ Responsive Layout with Media Queries

**Problem**: Layout didn't adapt to different screen sizes.

**Solution**: Implemented three responsive breakpoints with proper wrapping.

**Breakpoints**:

#### Desktop (>1200px)
- Board: 600px
- Side panels: 280px each
- Layout: `[Left Panel] [Board] [Right Panel]`

#### Tablet (768px-1200px)
- Board: 500px
- Panels stack below board
- Full-width panels

#### Mobile (<768px)
- Board: 450px (or 90vw)
- All elements stack vertically
- Reduced padding and gaps

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
@media (max-width: 1200px) {
    .game-container {
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    :root {
        --board-max-size: 450px;
        --panel-padding: 20px;
    }
}
```

**Result**: Game layout adapts beautifully to all screen sizes! 📐

## 🎯 SPACING & LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS

### 5. ✅ CSS Variables for Consistency

**Implementation**:
```css
:root {
    --board-max-size: 600px;
    --board-min-size: 400px;
    --panel-width: 280px;
    --gap-size: 20px;
    --piece-outline-black: 4px;
    --piece-outline-white: 3px;
    --piece-outline-king: 5px;
    --board-border: 8px;
    --panel-padding: 30px;
}
```

**Benefits**: Easy to maintain and adjust spacing across the entire app.

---

### 6. ✅ Improved Spacing

**Changes**:
- Body padding: 20px all sides
- Gap between elements: 20px
- Panel internal padding: 30px
- Board border: 8px (up from 4px)
- Piece size: 75% of square (better spacing)
- Panel border radius: 20px (up from 15px)

**Result**: Much more comfortable spacing throughout the UI! ✨

---

### 7. ✅ Better Piece Positioning

**Old System**:
```css
.piece {
    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    top: 5px;
    left: 5px;
}
```

**New System**:
```css
.piece {
    width: 75%;
    height: 75%;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

**Benefits**: 
- Pieces automatically scale with board size
- Perfect centering in squares
- Better spacing (25% margin around pieces)
